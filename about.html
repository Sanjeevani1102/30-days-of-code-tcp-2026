    <section>As a first-year BTech CSE student, I am in the early stage of my coding journey.<br> I have learned the basics of programming, especially in C/C++, including concepts such as variables, loops, conditional statements,<br> functions,arrays and have done basics of OOPs and HTML .

<br>I have practiced coding by solving simple problems and creating small programs like calculators and Student result.<br> These activities have helped me improve my logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
<br>
My key achievement so far is building a strong foundation in programming fundamentals and developing a genuine interest in software development. <br>I am continuously learning and exploring new concepts and looking forward to working on more projects and improving my coding skills.</section>
